# plugin.video.animeram - Animeram plugin for kodi

This is just an initial proof of concept version,
i still have alot to do.
please report any issue if you find one.

Until i'll get the addon into an offical repo, you can use the addon by click on 'Download as zip'
And then install addon from zip in kodi.

this is my first plugin, 
if someone with experiance with kodi video plugins sees this,
please contact me, if you feel like wanting to help :)
