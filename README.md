# plugin.video.animeram - Animeram plugin for kodi

Until i'll get the addon into an offical repo, you can use the addon by click on 'Download as zip'
And then install addon from zip in kodi.

This is just an initial proof of concept version,
i still have alot to do.
please report any issue if you find one.
